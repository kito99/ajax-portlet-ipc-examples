ajax-portlet-ipc-examples
=========================

Example code for the Java Magazine article "Responsive Inter-portlet Communication with Ajax" in the Mar/Apr 2013 issue of Java Magazine (http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine_open/20130304#pg1). Please refer to that article for a walk through of the code and a description of the portlets involved.

These examples were tested on Liferay 6.1 and use the Liferay Faces Bridge (http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/bridge).
Special thanks to Neil Griffin for providing his excellent examples, which were used as scaffolding for these examples.

Currently the repository contains a dump of my Eclipse projects; if you want a build script, either create a pull request or let me know; if enough people are interested I'll create a Gradle build script.

Enjoy!
